  - Migrated our self-service BI Tool Looker from Databricks (Spark) to Snowflake, incl. for automated tests via Looker API (shared in [public webinar w/ Snowflake](https://resources.snowflake.com/customer-stories/getyourguide-turning-travel-dreams-into-reality-with-snowflake), [blog article](https://medium.com/tech-getyourguide/migrating-our-self-service-bi-tool-looker-from-hive-apache-spark-to-snowflake-492441bca934) and Berlin data meetup)
  - Redesigned and centralized the architecture and layout of our daily prio1 reports end-to-end via Spark, Snowflake, Airflow and Looker
  - Build an application which enables the monitoring of our orchestration tool Airflow for tasks statistics (landing times) and its dependencies, reducing root cause analysis to seconds
  - Held internal learning session on Spark performance optimizations and shared learning on improvements on how to test our existing self service Spark SQL processing framework
  - Responsible for initial design and event ingestion for our CRM data model (event enrichment from Braze source data as well as building CRM subscriptions from existing events)
  - Building ETLs via Spark (S3 data lake) and enhancing data models (various teams like Finance, CRM, etc.)
