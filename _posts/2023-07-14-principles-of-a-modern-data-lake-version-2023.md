This post serves 2 needs:
* as a shareable reference for beginners that are new to the concepts of a data lake
* as a brain dump / refresher for myself

It is versioned for 2023 because principles may (and certainly will) change in the next years.
I'm shamelessly summarizing things from this [excellent blog post from Daniel Mateus Pires](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/a-guide-to-modern-batch-data-warehousing-extraction-f63bfa6ef878) and I'm adding things I've learnt since I started working with a data lake architecture at Getyourguide in 2020. 
A lot of the concepts were new to me as I was working before with classical RDBMS like Postgres and MySQL DBs. 
The differences actually also have implications on a few data modeling techniques.
I keep it short and concise as I prefer having a high level overview of concepts and perhaps later cover them in more depth.
